"It is really great to see exponential growth of AppliedAI. Team's efforts to consider each and every concern, and work on it is very much appreciable. Very soon AppliedAI will be one of top most and successful teaching platform.",Thank you for the kind words and the trusting us. We make sure every student who has trusted us will succeed through our course.
"I also want to make a startup like you in the AI field, this course give me  a good start for ml and deep learning. Till the end of my B.tech ,I want to gain as much as knowledge as possible, or i can say as impossible.Now, finished my first year.
Fully passionate for completing the case studies.","Learn as much as you can from this course and after your 2nd year onwards, start internships and by the time you sit for placements in your final year, you'll get as much exposure. In case if you are interested in  product development companies, along with ML, also gain strong command on CS fundamentals like Data Structures & Algorithms, Design Patterns, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, DBMS. Regarding the start up plans, once if you have some experience of around 3-5 years in the corporate, you can  think of a new startup because in order to run a startup along with the technical stuff, you also need management skills."
"sir, thanks for wonderful suggestions. But  What you suggest me regarding internships, I want to get some real world exposure by doing internship  in these summer vacations, I completed 10 to 11 assinments,
Now In 10 to 15 days I 'll complete all course content, just case studies 'll left after that.
I have full june month for completing some case studies and refresh concepts about machine learning then till the end of june ,I'll apply for internsip.
Is this good idea.","Make sure your internship doesn't clash with your classes in college. Yes you can start applying for internship once if you finish the course. Once if you finish all the course content, there are chances for you to crack internships in top IT companies"
What are design patterns?,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern
& https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-patterns-set-1-introduction/"
"Hi
first of all thank you for great course
Can you please provide some modules for reinforcement learning.","Adding more content to the current course would make it quite bulky for most of our students to finish and stay motivated through the course. Hence, we did not add Reinforcement Learning (RL) to it as of now. We do not want out our students to be overwhelmed by the course content and workload. While we want to add more content, we don't want to overburden the students.

We will probably create a new course (or) add RL to this course itself in the future (no guarantees) as optional topics. It should be easy for any of our students to pick up RL once they finish this course as they have all of the background in Maths and Deep-Learning.  Please note that no course can cover everything in ML. Often the content in this course itself is split across 2-3 courses. But we designed the course such that students can pick up new concepts fairly easily at the end of the course. Actually, some of our students have picked up RL at the end of this course fairly easily."
"Hi
Then I suggest please add another course for RL. I joined course not due to lack of material for ML online but due to organization and flow of course and the way you teach. So  I request you to please consider this request seriously. I will happily pay for another course from you.",We will surely inform you once we have the Reinforcement course ready (or) when we add RL as an optional content for this course.
"Hi team,
Thank you for your all efforts taken for designing such great content. Especially Varma sir's way of teaching and explaining difficult concepts in a very easy-to-understand manner is praiseworthy.
I have been doing this course for 4 months now and from my experience, I can say that your hard work reflects through all the components of this course, be it teaching, live lectures, doubt solving or the assignments.
I have one suggestion, 
It will be great if you make a telephone line available for doubt clarification regarding the assignments. Many times it's a small workaround that fixes the bug, but waiting for your reply via mail takes about a day and this, in turn, hampers the course progress.
Please make a telephonic helpline available for doubt clarification.",We encourage for doubts through mails. You can contact us at +918106920029/+916301939583 in case if you are looking for a phone call conversation with us.
Can we expect Reinforcement Learning to be added soon??..,"Please go through the comment thread:
http://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/11/applied-machine-learning-online-course#comment346"
"Sir, If this is the case, then my suggestion would be to give some introduction course about reinforcement learning and make it as optional.",We'll think of it.
It would be great in case there be a deep dive in Reinforcement Learning,So far we are not looking towards addding Reinforcement learning. But in future we may add it and you will be able to access it.
Once our validity gets over can we see those videos if you upload in future and do we need pay seperately for that ?,"Once if the course validity is over, you'll not be able to access any content in both website and classroom."
Sir i3 processor with 8Gb RAM is fine to complete this course,Yes it is enough.
Can I learn artificial intelligence in the field of mechatronics?,Please drop us your query at team@appliedaicourse.com. so that we can assist you better.
"HI Team,
I have 10+ years experience in IT. Currently working in Banking product implementation. My main concern is whether switching to AI/ML platform after 10+ experience is right was forward. Is it worth to take the risk of changing the domain now? My contact number: 98941 68004.",See I will suggest it is never late to switch the skills set.If you really want the edge over new skills you can consider it.It totally depends on the interest of one.
"Would like to suggest one functionality.
If you would create one dashboard where will get a ranking based on the respective assignment. It will be great.",Thanks for the suggestion!
"Hi 
Do I get certification after completing my appliedAI course?","Once after completion of the total course, we will send the certificate of completion through Email."
"sir,
In google classroom we can see there are 30 assignments, but in modules there are only 26 assignments including optional, is the number of assignments are reduced?",You will see the other ones in the case studies at the bottom. Also you'll see them getting added in your classroom as you keep progressing through the course.
"How many real-world projects can be done by your course in data science?
How many real-world projects can be done by your course in machine learning?

Waiting for reply. Thanks in advance",Please call us at 6301-939-583 (or) 8106-920-029. We'll clarify all your doubts.
"Is the syllabus given fixed. I mean is the content team adding new lectures , assignments or case studies ? It would be great to see reinforcement learning added , at least as optional so as to not burden the student with heavy syllabus.
RL is turning out be a very promising field in ML with very interesting applications  .This would be really helpful for those who need it. Thanks",Syllabus  is not fixed we keep adding the contents with time.We appreciate you suggestion and will look forward to it.
"Hi Team,
Can you please provide the assignments at the end of each module which will directly take us to google classroom's assigment?
And provide tick(like for videos) once the assignment is completed and graded by you.",Please drop a mail at team@appliedaicourse.com

"I am glad that all videos are searchable now and AppliedAI team really approachable and day by day you  are getting better,   you are reaching the level customer satisfaction is utmost, you guys are rocking...kudos to the entire team..",Thank you for the feedback!
I like this new site.Can you add a feature where I can see the questions that I have asked and liked module wise and chapter wise ?,Thanks for the suggestion!
can you please describe how tough the assignment is  is there nay video of that assignment so that i can judge myself because in most of the video they are saying that assignment are so tough that its impossible to complete the course in 1 year please give me some clarity,if you are motivated enough you can complete in 1year. if you watch all the videos and if you are clear with concepts you can complete assigments smoothly. some assignments takes time i.e also for machine to train the models and team is always there to help you out(btw i completed in 1year except one assignment)
so if in any case i am stuck at my assignments and i dont know what to do then who will help me and if u guys help me in the assignment then will i be consider for placements,"We'll be helping you out with the assignments and course queries. Yes, you'll be considered."
"and please tell how much students of yours have completed the full course in 1 year ratio wise ...i have a phobia of maths but i know programming ...so can i easily understand the algo like random forest knn,, nd other algo like these buy just watching your videos with 100% intrest",Please send an email to team@appliedaicourse.com
By adding Quiz at the end of every concept/chapter will help students better understanding and motivating?,"As of now, we do not have any plans of it. But in future, we may add it."
"I have 8 years of experience in IT in .NET technology, but now i want to in ML field. So my questions/doubts are below:-
1) Can i change my technology in this much experience and land in a good company as ML engineer.
2) This course is sufficient for me or some other course i need to do along with this.
3) How much it is difficult for me to switch to new technology.",Kindly mail us your contact number to team@appliedaicourse.com so that we can call you and answer all your queries over the phone. Also please mention what would be the best time to contact you.
"Is there content through which we can learn about video analysis, image processing and its applications?","No right now we do not deliver these topics.We teach end to end ML and deep learning along with python and other tools like pandas , numpy,etc"
"will there be any content further?
Please add if possible they are my requirements for projects.",When the new content is added we will notfiy.
Was any new content added i would like to know this to decide weather i should pay this course or not since machine learning is constantly evolving i would like a course that is constantly ipdaying with new content to keep the course uptodate it doesnt matter if the courses is lenghthy or not because at least we will be more prepared and have more things to learn the more the better so im just wandering is the course constantly updating its content,yes course is also constantly evolving as machine learning. every week course instructor will go live for 1-2hrs where he will pick a topic and go in great detail discussing about the topic
"I have logged in with gmail, but i want a seperate username and password to login. What should i do?","you can click on forgot password, then you will get a password reset link through email."
"Sir, I would like to do a PhD in Data Science. How can the Applied ML course help me? Thanks in advance.","This course provides you with a good overview of most of the popular ML and DeepLearning algorithms. But, the mathematical rigor we go into is not at a PhD Level as we focus more on applied and practical aspects more than theoretical proofs. But, we have many PhD students who take this course to understand how various techniques are actually sued in practice."
"Just a Suggestion :

Can you please put all the recorded audio for the query of student by module basis instead of finding it in the comments. This will definitely help student a lot and decrease some amount of question asked to you.",Thanks for the suggestion!
"Hi Team, 
I always had this query, as we all know course validity is 1year and your team adds new content to the playlist every now and then as per your YouTube live sessions,
So how can 1year old student of this course can access the new content, if not then wouldn't it be a loss for  him in terms of knowledge gain.
Please help me with this query and also let me know business timings of your team to have a phone call conversation before I enroll this course. CHEERS!!",The validity of course is 365 days. You can call use between 10 am-6 pm.
I also would like to know. I keep coming back to this website and thinking about enrolling BUT no access to material after 365 days throws me off. I really like the course - to me it would make sense if I do not have access to assignments and future updates. I should have continued access to video content that I use as revision or reference. All other major program providers are giving the live time access ...,Please drop a mail at team@appliedaicourse.com
"I don't know the team's idea regarding 365 days validity, but in my opinion, if the course is life long validity students will not feel the motivation at all to complete it. It just makes us lazy day by day. We may keep on postponing it for 2+ years. That is not at all helpful to someone who wants to grow as  ML engineer or Data scientist.  If one has that utmost interest to complete the course within some stipulated time (even if it is lifetime validity) then it is sure that he can definitely complete it in one year. What it requires is sheer concentration and interest to learn. If it is a limited time period, although we may feel hurry at sometimes we can learn at our own pace and extend the validity after a year and get a highly qualified job. Purpose Served!","Yes, you are correct. This is the reason for 1-year validity."
"Access to course content is different to an actual program. You have dated assignments and deadlines that you have to complete to pass in 365 days. Having access to content for future review is something AppliedAI should consider. Other ML program providers are already doing it. That way you will also gain more students. Sure make deadlines for assignments/case studies/any deliverables, but make content video lectures accessible for lifetime.","Previously we used to have deadlines for the assignments, but this course is not taken only by the students. Even the working professionals are also enrolling for this course and they were not able to meet their deadlines as they have to balance their work, home and this course. So we have removed the topicwise deadlines, but we have kept the course deadline of 365 days like that only. Also 365 days of time is sufficient to complete all the assignments of this course provided if you consistently putting your efforts."
"Hello Sir, Do i need to watch the live sessions in each module after the completion of Course videos of each module, or can i first watch all the course videos, complete the assignments and then watch the live sessions?

Watching Live sessions are necessary for assignment completion, or should i watch them after i have completed the assignments?",We recommend you to watch the live sessions associated with each topic immediately after finishing the chapter asociated with that topic. This way you could learn the topic in much more depth as most of the live sessions are the deep dives of the topics.
"Dear team
A small suggestion to implement if possible.
Could you please highlight the item of Table of Content in the right if we are watching the particular item  video ? For example, module 3, chapter 1, we have 20.4 as Bag of Words. If we are watching the same, Bag of Words item on the right side in Table of Content should be highlighted.",Thanks for your suggestion!
"Could you please add comment section under each assignment in classroom, so we can get clarifications and clear our doubts about the corresponding assignment. The slack doesn't help as it is not inituitive to use also we cant even see past comments beyond few days. It being not organized as per assignment also makes it even difficult to use.
The video in assignment is not enough as lot of time we are stuck trying to solve a problem because of a assumption we eneded up making, just having a comment section helps in removing and clarifying those doubts.
A comment section below each assignment would help a lot.","There is a comment section for each assignment but you can access it once you try to submit the assignment
Please refer to this link. The comment section is placed on the left side of the image."
"It would be preferable to have a comment section where the details of assignment are given. As there is lot of small doubts about what the assignemnt is asking or when there is a bit of ambiguity eg in  formulas,  if everything is in summation or part of it. or if while taking samples is it with or without replacement. Such little confusion take up a lot of time. So if others have such issues those can be resolved in comment and can be answered.  Because the team still takes a day to answer. Common doubts can quickly get resolved as once the team answers the confusion can be removed once for all",Thanks for the suggestion!
"1.Do we have to complete the live session videos in chapter 1 compulsorily to get course completion?
2. Will it be added for other modules as well apart from python?","Just to clarify,course completion is not about the video completion but about the assignment completion"
Do you recommend 1st Year Engineering students to join the course or wait till second year till all the fundamentals of CS is clear?,First year student can join because all the programming fundamentals are also covered in the course. Person with no programming background can join.
"Hello Team,

Thanks for the new look of the website with additional features.

Just wanted to provide some suggestion on the navigation of the particular topic w.r.t  breadcrumbs on the top, in each of the topic page.

For example,  Log Normal Distribution in Probability and Statistics,  can be displayed like below:
Home -> Courses -> Applied Machine Learning Online Course-> Data Science : Explanatory Data Analysis and Data Visualization -> Probability and Statistics -> 12.15 Log Normal Distribution

Now it's displaying like below  :
Home -> Courses -> Applied Machine Learning Online Course-> Log Normal Distribution

If the same is implemented, we can navigate to any of the module, chapter or topic, etc.",Thank you for the feedback! We'll include it in our next iteration of updates.
"Sir, Which white board tool youare using for conducting the session?",We use Ink2Go.
Do we need to do log transformation on both dependent variable and independents variables in linear and logistic regression,"Usually, it is done on independent variables."
sir..as srikanth sir mentioned in live session there will be interview questions after each chapter.. but i cant able to find that.. can you please guide me where ill found that or give any link of them..,"In each module, you can find a few chapters named 'Interview Questions on topic'. The questions start from Probability and statistics chapter."
"hi sir, i wanted to know what type of projects we can put in resumes after completing the course , as we cant put netflix recommendation system, amazon food reviews as our projects , so please suggest what type of projects we can put in resume to get calls.","You can put the case studies covered in the course as projects in your resume. But, we would suggest you put your own self case studies other than those covered in the course. You will get more ideas as you go through videos."
"Hi, for microsoft malware case study , can I do this on google colab instead of google cloud or azure ?Because I cant do it on local machine.",Yes you can run that on google colab.
Have this course contain anything about reinforcement learning?,"As of now, Reinforcement Learning is not yet added, but in future we may add it to the course."
"Please add it in the course, because without reinforcement learning AI is incomplete I think.",Thanks for the suggestion!
Have this course contain any videos about Q learning?,"No, we have not covered q-learning in this course."
"Sir, Can I get a job in tier-1 companies just with the completion of this course(with 80% in assessments) or I will have to do something else(additional).","Yes, you have to finish the case studies in this course and we have mentors to guide you in preparation for the companies you target for and also we help you with profile building that matches the company's expectations."
"Can in this course have any content for in depth use of various deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, Keras, etc.",We have used tensorflow and keras in the course.
"Can I get any Certificate,  after finish this course ?","Yes, you will get a course completion certificate if you finish all the assignments and get them evaluated."
What the system requirement need for this course.,"It is good to have a laptop with around 8Gb of RAM minimum,with i7 processor, 4G graphics card from NVIDIA(if you want to run deep learning programs which is optional, generally 1050Ti and above is preferable). You can also look into Google Colab for running the code."
If i use Google Colab then can I use properly all of things in this course or it give me a limitation.,You can use Google Colab. There is no limitation.
"Hello, what are the prerequisites to join this course? Do we need to know any programming languages or have an understanding of AI?",There are no prerequisites for this course. A programming language is taught in the course.
"Hi team,
I want to learn datastructure and algorithms.And,I know only Python,which I learned from here.So,please guide me.","You can refer GeeksForGeeks to learn Data Structures and Algorithms.
You also can refer the book Introduction to Algorithms here."
"Please increase the logged in session time. After watching a 30 min video it again ask for login. It is really frustrating to keep login every time. Once the login is done, it redirects to the main website page, then again we have to traverse to machine learning course page, then again to our module and then click to next video. Please understand this minute but irritating problem and solve it. Thanks",Thank you for the feedback. We'll do the needful.
What can the ApplieAI team say about the average package from the Job gaurantee programme(for a fresher)??,"The average package for a candidate depends on different factors like the candidate's educational background, skillset the candidate possess, type of the company the candidate is trying for, type of projects/portfolio the candidate has worked on, etc. We suggest you to kindly call us on 91-8106-920-029 for further queries regarding the job guarantee program."

"Hi Team,

Suppose I am on a specific video but I visit the webpage after a few hours. The website says ""content restricted. Please login"" which is fine. However, after i login, I am taken bacvk to the homepage where I have to again go to a chapter and select that video. Is it possible to automatically relog me back in to the current page i am on. That would be great! Thanks :)","We will check once if we have any bug, we will try to remove that. 
But, f you are not logged in any other computer then you will go the same page where the session got inactivated because of Time. 
If the session got inactivated because of the other login from another IP, then after relogin, it will go to the main page."
"Hi team,

Thanks for the response. It appears that if I click on a video after my login has expired, it says 'content restricted .. please login'. After I login i am redirected to the course home page. Note that I am using the same IP.","Thanks for your confirmation. We will look into this issue with our SDE team. if we have any bug, we will rectify it."
"There is no Real-World Case study on solving Regression problem. If there is one case study on that too, then it would be very helpful.",Please look into Taxi demand Prediction case study.
"Hi Team ,
Thanks a lot for the great course .One suggestion I would like to add here .Most of the candidates may ask questions that are not relevant  or that question is already posted in comment sections so its fair from your side not to approve those comments . But we all know each and every doubt is important so even if you don't approve , please send one mail elaborating doubt and the reason for not approving those comment . It would help a lot .",Thanks for your suggestion and We are doing the same thing now.

"There is a lot of inconsistency in video players of each lecture. Sometimes its a youtube player which when paused shows recommendations, which most of the times blocks the entire screen when watching on phone. Sometime its a vimeo video player which sometimes has but sometimes does not have a full screen option. Each page does have a full screen option which covers the page, not much issue on a browser but a big issue in phone as browser address bar take a lot of space. Other times the video player has full screen option which properly goes full screen. The problem is none of this is consistent, constantly the format switches from lecture to lecture. Which bearable on a laptop but extremely problamatic on a phone. Could all the videos use one consistent video player. Which does not show recommended videos, gives a proper full screen option, and a video playback speed modifier (almost available on all videos when watching on laptop but missing in half the videos when watching from phone). CONSISTENTLY without any constant changing formats, Its a big issue when trying to view on phones. Please do the needfull",Thank you for the feedback. We'll look into it.
I have reached the end of Module-1. Should I do SQL now or after deep learning?,We suggest you to attempt SQL assignment after finishing the Deep Learning assignments as we advise you not to waste much time on SQL right now.
"In module 3, often there is reference to SQL database while importing the data. So, would u suggest doing SQL at the end of module -1 or after deep learning ?",You can work on SQL assignment after completing Deep Learning Assignments.
"One suggestion:-

One suggestion - Please add Applied AI Course as a school as well on linkedin so that we can show what we have learned in detail.,You will actually get a certificate from AppliedAI once if you finish all the assignments. You can add the softcopy of this certificate on your Linkedin profile and make it visible to the recruiters.
"Loved the way, this new site is responding and the overall look and feel, but a small suggestion only if its possible. Is there a way you can showcase the total number of hours per module and overall hours. I understand that you mentioned that to be 150+ hours but if we have the number of hours per module, we can plan on completing the course module wise. Just a suggestion not a mandatory ask. 
Thank you.","Sure, we will be adding this feature soon."
New website is awesome. 1 suggestion: please add progress bar under module  to track which sub-topic is not complete or you can add green tick if a sub-topic is complete. Otherwise  its cumbersome to track.,"The percentage of completion of each module is already present in the website. Within that if you have finished any sub-topic and have clicked on ""COMPLETE"" option, then you'll be able to see a green color tick mark"
Will registering for the course give me access to videos for unlimited amount of time?,The access to the course will be given for a period of 1 year. You have to finish the course within an year.
"After finishing course, what if i want to browse some of the videos later 2 or 3 years ? Will I have access ?","At this point of time, videos are accessible for 365 days only."
Loved new UI of the applied ai.  It's much stable dan previous one. ?,Thank you for the feedback.
Recently I was using old version of website. The some of the videos i completed are not showing in completed status in new website.,We are working towards it. Within a short time it gets resolved.
"Hi team,
is this problem resolved bcos i am still facing this issue.",It has been resolved long back. Please make sure you are logged in and check for the course and video status.
"The individual progress is being displayed but not the overall process like in old site, that also can be added.","Yes, it will be added soon"

The content in each of the videos are intuitive also many tough topics are elucidated clearly. I really appreciate if you could also include more Deep Learning content along with Reinforcement Learning content which is totally absent in the course.,We intentionally left out Reinforcement learning not to overwhelm the students. We have covered most of the key concepts in deep learning and would surely add more in the near future. Thank you for your feedback.
"sir,
   I had 10 years of teaching experience in academics. I teach courses like Probability and  stochastic process, Image Processing. I am presently pursuing PhD on ""Speech Recognition"". I am specifically oriented towards speech recognition and Deep Speech. I glanced through  course and contents in deep learning as well. So, will this course give enough prerequisites to understand and implement Deep Speech. Or in other way, can i choose project from deep speech which really helps in broaden my skills for my research?
PS: I am also looking for job change, after successful completion of assignments and project (exclusively on Speech), can i expect assistance to specifically look at companies working on speech?","Hi Veerender, this course covers all of the basics you need to build deep-learning based speech systems. We will also closely work with you on speech+DL based projects. But, we CANNOT guarantee you a job in the speech domain exclusively as there are limited openings in speech processing in India. We will certainly assist you but cannot guarantee you. If you are open to other areas of ML, our Job Guarantee program is anyway applicable to all of our students."

"1. Do you also cover the Markov models?
2. Also, do you teach Image processing as part of the course? as it will be required in few of the case studies that involve data as images
3. The case studies that are mention in the end like human activity recognition, do you only give a brief overview, or they are taught like rest of the others in detail? How do you go about teaching them?
4. We have to choose which case studies to pursue, or we can try all of them out? How exactly do you go ahead about them?",Audio reply: https://soundcloud.com/applied-ai-course/mehek-kawatra-comment/s-qVvLj
"Hi sir,

Its better if the course includes a separate section for sequence models, where the section involves techniques like hmm, Maximum entropy markov models, conditional random fields. These are some of the good algorithms for NLP sequence labeling tasks.",Audio reply: https://soundcloud.com/applied-ai-course/hmm-and-crf
The topics that are covered in AAIC is so extensive that you would anyway feel overwhelmed but if you still need to cover HMMs please do check out Siraj's move 37 https://www.theschool.ai/courses/move-37-course/,"Mayukh,
We have NOT covered HMMs as most applications like NLP and Speech recognition which used HMMs a decade back currently use RNNs which we cover in lots of detail in this course including multiple case studies involving RNNs. We have tried to cover the most important techniques used in the industry today and avoid those which are not extensively used as of now. But the course gives you the necessary tools and basics to learn most concepts of ML/AI at the end of the course as no course can cover everything."
"Hello,

  I know that and I have told exactly that thing only. That AAIC is very extensive. But if for some reason anyone still needs to cover HMMs, then that link would be useful. Giving an additional resource would never harm right.


PS. I am already pursuing AAIC","Thank you Mayukh. Certainly, more resources are always better as students can get a broader perspective on various topics."

"I am just trying to define these three definitions in my own understanding. Please correct me if i am wrong.

Data Science:

Data Science is the art/technique of deriving some meaningful insights from the Data by applying scientific methodologies. The Data could be either structured or un-structured, The methods could be maths, statistics or even some formulas from [domain specific]. 
All we do is extract information and patterns in that data, visualize the data and observe nature/tendencies in it.


Machine Learning:
It is a set of techniques by which we make a computer program [Model] to understand underlying pattern by applying an algorithm. Its like a defining a theorm[model] with proof[accuracy]. 
In a single word : Understand the Actual[past] data pattern -> Predict Unseen/Future data

Deep Learning:
It is same as Machine learning, however there are extra layers or further deep understanding in patterns for most un-structured data. For example images, videos.


Artificial Intelligence: 
It is process of making a system to mimic a human being which could eventually does the task and even can think on its own. An ideal AI system could even learn on its own i.e understand the data on its own, suggest algos on its own.",yes correct. we had a video on this. please go through it. refer this
Why there is no Tableau content?Feeling disappointed everything about this syllabus was good missing Data visualization main tools,we do consider your suggestion of adding Tableau content aswell

"Can you please add another tab with audio transpicts for all the videos. This would help me in revising the content, listening to them on the go using my mobile and will consume less mobile data.

Also, please add subtitles for all the videos. This would help in watching the videos at higher speed. If possible, please include support till 3x speed in the video player. As of now it is only supporting 2x speed.","Thank you for the constructive suggestions. We are working on adding 3x speed to the video player. We are also working on sharing notes for the videos which will help you revise faster. You can expect these in the next 2 weeks. As for subtitiles, we will do it a little later as we need to implement this feature in our audio player. But, we hope the notes and 3X features will help you revise much faster."
In the assignment of performance metrics for dataset 5_a.csv in the proab score column there is all value > 0.5 so every value in predicted y will become 1. SO this is correct that every predicted value will be 1.0?There will be no 0.0 because all the score is > 0.5. I am right?,"Yes, correct."

"Hi team,

I have one small question. I have realised that with continuous revision, I have a very strong hold of the concepts taught in the course, and I almost know the nitty gritty of almost every course video's topics, however I tend to forget about the good things that I read from blogs. I tend to make notes of something good that I encounter in a blog, but if I keep making notes of every blog now and then, the notes would get so big that I would barely be able to revise them. So how do I efficiently remember the interesting things from the blogs? any suggestion? I know this varies from person to person, but still if you could give some tips it'd be helpful.",Dont write long notes instead read those blogs and write summaries in your words and keep on revising / reading that summary so that it will be easy and time consuming.
"Hi team, 
wanted to give a feedback about the comment section, where in we write a comment.

1. For Balanced Dataset: (Assuming your dataset is balanced)
i. If Train and CV accuracy are similar and the test accuracy is low then there may be some data leakage issue from CV to train due to which it is overfitting to the Train and Cv datasets.

"Hello sir,

In the ridge regression model,  the equation has two parts,   a+lamda(b), where a is the sum of squared errors and b is regularization term. how can we show that as lambda increases, 'a' increases?

Thank you, sir.",Please go through this video.
"Hello sir,

can we prove it mathematically? if yes, can you please explain it?

Thank you sir.","squared loss is (y−y^)2=(y−(W.x+b))2(y−y^)2=(y−(W.x+b))2(y-\hat y)^2 = (y - (W.x+b))^2 and regularization = λ.||W||λ.||W||\lambda.||W||. Now Our aim is to decrease the ( Loss + reg ) so i have the decrease the regularization term as well. Now, If my λλ\lambda increases, my regularization term(λ.||W||λ.||W||\lambda.||W||) will increase but I am trying to decrease the regularization term so ||W||||W||||W|| must decreases while optimization because of the increase in the  λλ\lambda. 
If  ||W||||W||||W|| is decreasing, y^y^\hat y will decrease and squared loss will increase. Another important point is the threshold of  λλ\lambda totally depends on data we have."
"Hi team, as a suggestion, if you could add a Course progress monitoring section for each account like a simple line graph of minutes of content watched each day/ percentage of course completed in one-day on the y-axis and the dates on x-axis, it'd be very much helpful to us, like we'll be able to see if we're maintaining a constant progress or do we need to put in more effort. 

Also, if you could return the grade/marks obtained in each assignment, it'd be more useful than rather just accepted or rejected.
Thank you :)",Thanks for the suggestion! We will let you know once we add such a feature.

i3 processor,3GB ram and 87.8 hard disk size.....is it sufficient to complete the course?","No, you might find some difficulty in running some assignments. You can use google colab. It's free and offers GPU with 12 gb of ram."
"The course content is very good but I would like to highlight one issue faced by the aspirants enrolled with this course.
The assignments in this course are based on very large dataset because of which it takes frustratingly large time to run and sometimes system also fails due to memory limitation. GCP also does not seem to be very useful.
Ur content is very classy, so if you re-design the assignment and make it a bit aspirant friendly, it would encourage aspirants.",As per our experience here students have not faced much such issue with i5 and 8-12 gb ram is sufficient.

"If I buy this course, will I get lifetime access or access period is limited?",The validity of the course is 365 days.
May I know what is the reason for having a limited time period for this course?,"The reason for having a specific time period is to create seriousness and punctuality among the students and make them finish the course and learn the concepts thoroughly within a specified time.  If there is no specific time period, it might take years and still most of the students will not be completing the course due to lack of seriousness. Also the stuents might gets distracted from the course if they have infinite amount of time. Hence we have specified the validity period as 1 year keeping not only the college students, but also the working professionals in the mind.

Is it should be module 5,6,7,8,9 but assignment numbers in classroom given are in different sequence here as 10th assignment is in 7th module. Then I would have to submit assignment 10 after many like 15,16,17,19 and 20.",Just follow the course content and submit it in that order only as there is in course.

"Hi sir, that means even after completing 30 assignments, if we perform bad or average in 2  mock interview, you wont refer us to better companies?","Depending on your performance, skillset, previous work experience(if any), the mentors would prepare you for the main interviews and in this process you'll have to clear 2 mock interviews which are taken by ML experts from AppliedAI. If you are able to crack those interviews and build a strong portfolio then only you'll be referred to companies."
"Hi sir, then how job guarantee will work now. if we complete 30 assignments and not clear mock interview , that means no referrals and no placement. now, we will get a refund? as we wont get placed. (According to the job guarantee terms). concerned before joinig the course","The day when you register for the course, within 24 hours you'll be given full access to the course. You need to finish the video lectures & assignments(total 30) within an year. Among these 30 assignments, when you finish the first 15 assignments, you'll have 1 round of mock interview & parallelly you'll be made to work on 16-20 assignments. When you finish 20th assignment, you'll have 2nd mock interview. After that you'll be asked to work on 21-30 assignments.
In case if you fail in any of the mock interview, you'll be given some time & the interview will be rescheduled. 
From the day you have finished all the assignments, you'll will be placed within 6 months from that day. If we are not able to get placed even after putting such huge efforts & finishing the assignments, then your course fee of 25K will be refunded.

But during this 6 months in whichever company they refer you(as per your requirement), you have to attend the interview. Even after that if you're still not yet placed, then the course fee of 25K will be refunded. So far no one has reached this stage of getting refund.

"Hello Sir
The new website is cool. I wanted to know if there is a change in the course content. In the previous website there were lecture videos on mysql which I can't find it here. Also  the  videos  on the live sessions are not available.
Thank you",They are shifted. But the videos are still there.. Please go through each module and you will find them
"which i observed,
In the link, could not see the assignments list.
By clinking Assignments  it is listing the topics only. It is not switching to assignments page.",Assignments are there in their respective lessons.
"Few suggestions:
1. Module 3 should be named appropriately > Module 4 named as Machine Learning II, so it will be ok here to just name Module 3 as Machine Learning I only.

2. There are also Supervised learning elements in Module 3 but we are explicitly indicating it in the Module 4 name (Supervised learning in bracket). This is creating confusion.

Other suggestion:
1. We would like to stay associated with AAIC for life time or at least for a period of 4-5 years. Please plan a package to accommodate the requirement. Please come out with some economic plan.
2. Include Factor Analysis
3. Dataset used: Please include case studies using dataset pertaining to financial industries (non text based data)..this will help us to understand things at ease and apply  in our domain.

"Hi Team,
 The new website is fast.
please add assignment name also","Sure we will add it, thanks for your feedback."
"Though the new site got wonderful l experience and performance over the old one, if we add two more features(1-placing the ""completed"" at bottom of the video, 2- Instead of scrolling the complete web-page for video lectures/table of content, it would be better if we separate both so that we can stay for the video lecture and the navigation is easy for the lecture content).","Thanks for your feedback, we are working on it and try to add these features soon."
there is offline videos means good incase internet not available our studies wont disturb,"Thanks for the suggestion, we will consider this in future."

Suggestions:
1. Indexing chapter.
2. Amount of time of playlist of module(1.40min) just like VLC playlist would be awesome.This also helps breaking down studies in small section.
3. Jupyter notebook of module all together, don't want to download after each video.
4. Link of all Jupyter notebook dropbox link at bottom here
5. Hoping I can see  entire module video playlist at one time, clicking and opening one video at time every 15min is distracting. 
6 Coursera course has simple quiz about concept which helps to evaluate we understood problem, it is also rewarding.
7. App would be great!

P.S: Website is great even at this point of time, it is just high expectation to make it more convenient. 
-Millennial Student","Thanks for your feedback, we are working on it and try to add more features."
"I am not able to see the live session videos which were there in the previous version, adding them would really help a lot",We will try to add them soon.
"Hi team,
A new website has a very good design than the previous one. It is very good to make a plan for the study.",Thanks for your review.
"New website is really fast, also arrangement of course content and %age completion for each module gives clear picture of progress.
Good work!",Thanks for your review. :-)
Which option is best for this course and why?  Desktop PC vs Kaggle Kernels with GPU vs Google Collab,"It depends a lot on the sepecifications of the systems and the case study you are solving. I would say explore all the free options that you have.. You would know their limitations and have experience those too. Kaggle kernels and google colab notebooks are good but they have a maximum runtime limit. PC is good if it is really made well and you spend some good money. Consequently, you can also use Google cloud if you have a credit card because learning good cloud is considered an extra skill in software industry."

"Hi team,

Under 'Deep Learning:Neural Networks' in module 8, the videos do not seem in the right order. ex. after 49.4 there is 'Training MPL: Memoization' which I cannot follow because it starts with computing derivatives of terms I do not understand how they were obtained.
Thank you.",We'll look into it and will let you know if any corrections are made.
where are linear regression models and logistic regression and also ridge lasso regressions elastic net etc. Those are missing. I believe these are important,They are present in the module 3 named Logistic regression and Linear regression. You will find regularization techniques in the chapter of logistic regression.
"Dear Team,
It would be better for us, if an option  to view offline videos(server download) is provided. Offline viewing option would help us to come over the network fluctuations that we usually face in most places, especially during travel or commuting to office.","There's nothing like we shouldn't standardize the numerical data. When we are working with counts based data, it is good to standardize the data. In case if we are working on binary data, there's no need to standardize the data."

I have seen RPA is much booming nowadays. How is RPA different from Machine Learning? Which one is advantage and which one is good in terms of Career? Kinldy provide more information on this.,"RPA is a fast evolving field with a good number of openings nowadays. But, RPA is limited in its scope of what is automatable using specific tools. ML, on the other hand, is more generic and it can do everything that an RPA tool can do and much more. Hence, the opportunities for ML are a lot more across many industries and across a wide spectrum of problems. To be clear, RPA is easier to learn and pick up as compared to ML. While ML is a more foundational skill, RPA is mostly a functional tool.  

The choice boils down to how much effort you can put in. If you are willing to put in more effort and learn a foundational skill, ML is the way to go. If you want to quickly learn a new and cool tool and ride the wave of opportunities, RPA is a way to go."

"Hi Team,
Could you pls tell me if I am working on Insurance Fraud Claim.If it is being told that Random forest is among the best algorithm,
then why not to apply it directly on the Insurance dataset,instead of trying any others(Since RF is well tested algorithm)? 
Pls clarify in real world scenario.
Secondly,What is SMOTE?How to apply?

Thanks","1. Why not use GBDT or SVM or another method? Why RandomForest? It is best to choose the best-performing algorithm that also satisfies other business and real-world constraints like latency, interpretability, cost of training and evaluation, availability of probabilistic class labels etc.

It is best to try out various methods which satisfy the real-world constraints and pick the one that actually performs best. It is best to avoid any favorites. If the data shows that RF is the best method for your task, then you should certainly go with it. 

2. SMOTE is a method to generate synthetic and new data-points using k-NN especially when we want to tackle the class-imbalance problem through upsampling.

"Hi Team,
What is the difference between Regularized Logistic regression and linear svm?
Thanks","Both objectives have the same components: the loss function and the L2 penalty. It is also true that these two models often give very similar performance. 
However there is fundamental difference: Logistic Regression outputs probabilities and SVM maximizes the margin. The point of SVMs is that is ignores all but the close points (support vectors) in the loss. In that sense it ""maximizes margin"" quite explicitly in a way that logistic regression does not."

"Hi Team,
Why GBDT provides better performance 
and accuracy than bagging(RANDOM FOREST)?
Pls elaborate.

Thanks",GBDT does not always give better performance than random forest. but many times we will get better performance because it trains tree based on errors of before tree. random forest makes many trees with random sample data and gives the majority vote.
"Why we are taking F0(x)=L(Yi-gamma) instead of F0(x)=L(Yi-Ypred) as error should be initially Yi-Ypred to start with,Rather that not being (Yi -gamma) in GBDT or XGBOOST?
Pls clarify in detail,as I am totally confused.

Thanks","gamma in base model F0 indicated predictions values only. don't confuse with learning rate gamma, that is different."
"But as in wikipedia,

F0(x)= argmin_gamma SUM_1ton{ L(Yi,gamma) }

"Hi Team,

I went through some of the free available videos. And I could see that you are explaining the concepts in a fairly easy manner but my concern is about the code. I could listen the faculty saying that we can download the code using notebooks but what is the meaning of each line of code? Which function is doing what? What else can we write to accomplish that same thing?

As I am from programming background, I know that we can accomplish one task with many different ways, that is why, I am a bit confused and curious to know the answer to this please.

Where can we get the answers to these queries? It would be great, if you can help me getting answers to these queries.

Thanks,
Gurmeet Kaur","Gurmeet, we explain the basics of Python in the very first chapter. We also explain each of the key functions in detail as and when we progress through the course. But, as we progress through the code, we may not go line by line as we have seen similar code earlier. If you do not understand any segment of code, feel free to put it in the comments section under the video. We would respond with a clarification. It is impossible to cover all the ways to achieve the same task as there are sometimes tens of ways to do the same using different functions and libraries. We try and provide one of the more commonly used and efficient ways. Additionally, we want our students to have the ability to navigate through ML code comfortably by the end of the course. Hence, we avoid going over code line by line in the later chapters of the course as similar concepts have been covered in earlier chapters. If there is some new concept, we would surely go over it in detail. We want our students to put in the effort to understand the code on their own especially in later chapters as they would have to do it in their jobs once they complete the course. If there is any blocker, we are always here to help.

"Hi,
What is likelihood,log-likelihood and maximum likelihood?
What is maximum likelihood in logistic regression?
Thanks","1. Given the observed data and a model of interest, we need to find the one Probability Density Function/Probability Mass Function (f(x|?)), among all the probability densities that are most likely to have produced the data.

To solve this inverse problem, we define the likelihood function by reversing the roles of the data vector x and the (distribution) parameter vector ? in f(x| ?), i.e.,

L(?;x) = f(x| ?)

In MLE, we can assume that we have a likelihood function L(?;x), where ? is the distribution parameter vector and x is the set of observations. We are interested in finding the value of ? that maximizes the likelihood with given observations (values of x).

2.Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a technique used for estimating the parameters of a given distribution, using some observed data. For example, if a population is known to follow a normal distribution but the mean and variance are unknown, MLE can be used to estimate them using a limited sample of the population, by finding particular values of the mean and variance so that the observation is the most likely result to have occurred.


3. For many applications, the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, called the log-likelihood, is more convenient to work with. This is because we are generally interested in where the likelihood reaches its maximum value: the logarithm is a strictly increasing function, so the logarithm of a function achieves its maximum value at the same points as the function itself, and hence the log-likelihood can be used in place of the likelihood in maximum likelihood estimation and related techniques."

"Hi,

I am interested to pursue this course online. So, as a part of this, will I be installing any software(s) during the course duration? If so, then what should be the basic configuration of the laptop that I use while pursuing this course online?",For GPU you can go with 1050ti Nvidia graphic card or 1060 or 1070. Try to assemble an SSD with >=128G. Keep a minimum of 8G ram preferable 16G. The hard disk is your call.
"Hi,

I have a total of 8+ years of experience in Siebel CRM data migration. I have enrolled in this course last month and am really excited and i must say i am really enjoying it. But i do have some concerns as well.

Since i have a lot of experience in CRM (particularly in migrating data from legacy systems to Siebel databases):

1. Are there opportunities in ML on CRM data in big companies?
2. I would like to do 2-3 case studies in CRM area, will Applied AI team support and mentor me in understanding the CRM scenarios and help me in completing the case studies?
3. Do companies hire 8+ years experience guy like me with fresh knowledge of ML considering the CTC expectation would be high compared to other fresh graduates who have completed the course?

Very much appreciate your reply on this. Thank you very much!

Regards,
Mohammed Arif","1. Yes, Some of the largest CRM software developers like Salesforce have invested heavily in AI and built tools like Einstein. So, CRM is certainly a very fertile area for applications of AI as it contains lots of text and customer data.

2. Certainly, as you progress through the course, we will work closely with you to build a portfolio of projects around the CRM field as it is your corer area of expertise. We will need lots of inputs from you on the domain-knowledge front as we are not experts in CRM. But, we can certainly will mentor you o the ML front.

3. We have had students who have transitioned to ML roles with your kind of experience. But, the effort needed would certainly be more as you will have to prove your ML expertise + Domain expertise as employers would expect more advanced case-studies in your portfolio. Employers do pay a premium for domain expertise, which is critical for most ML projects. I think it is too early to talk about compensation now, but we will put in our best efforts to land you in the best possible role based o your expertise."

How does ridge regression solves multicollinearity?Why lasso don't?,"Yes, ridge Regression used when the data suffers from multicollinearity ( independent variables are highly correlated). In multicollinearity, even though the least squares estimates (OLS) are unbiased, their variances are large which deviates the observed value far from the true value. By adding a degree of bias to the regression estimates, ridge regression reduces the standard errors. Ridge regression solves the multicollinearity problem through shrinkage parameter ? (lambda). Have a look at the link here:
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/104779/why-does-ridge-regression-work-well-in-the-presence-of-multicollinearity"
"Hi,
I already went before through the link but couldn't get intuation.Could you pls simplify a bit more.
And,why don't lasso(ya I got that it sparsity very easily through your video.But,why not solves multicollinearity?).
Thanks.","If two predictors are highly correlated LASSO can end up dropping one rather arbitrarily. That's not very good when you're wanting to make predictions for a population where those two predictors aren't highly correlated, & perhaps a reason for preferring ridge regression in those circumstances."
Thanks.How does multicollinearity affects Random Forest?Actually I encountered this question.,"In terms of prediction, it does not affect much if the effect of multi-collinearity presents in both the train and test. However, feature importance score would be influenced, just like other methods such as linear/logistic regression.

The explanation can be simplified if we consider two collinear variables. If two strong variables are chosen for a decision tree in RF, one must be picked for each split consideration and the other would not likely be picked again since the former has already explained the output variation for both of them (*). The prediction power of that tree does not drop though, so does the RF.

However, in feature importance score, once one of the two is picked, the other variable is less important to bring any further output variation explanation since the two are correlated well. The overall importance of these two will be reduced"
"Hi Applied AI team,

Seaborn topic is not covered in EDA, Without basics unable to understand the code related to the seaborn package, Can anyone help me on it.

"Does this course contains -
1. OpenCV 
2. Audio Recognition topics (including audio preprocessing)","1. We do cover OpenCV to the extent we need for our case-studies involving self-driving car. We donot dive deep into OpenCV as this is not a computer vision course.
2. We perform lots of time-series analysis using Fourier transforms and discuss about Spectrograms as a featurization of audio data. We have a case-study about Music generation where we touch upon some audio topics like music encodings. But, as this is not an audio-processing course, we do not dive too deep into audio-signal processing and dive deep into techniques like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC).

As part of our course, you will gain the ability to learn many concepts in CV and Audio-processing and use these concepts for ML tasks. We have had students who learned about and used MFCC to build singer detection systems. Similarly, our students were able to pick up SIFT and other feature engineering techniques in CV and apply ML models on top of them."

    please correct me if I am Wrong
 1. C.I. is tool/technique which is using to making Rough not exact calculated estimation about data.
 2. It Gives us confidence that my calculation or understanding about data is x% of range is Right rather than throwing stones in the darkness.

But do we need to take samples of data every time like it shouldn't be mandatory activity, Right?

thanks.","Yes, C.I gives you a range of values for a random-variable (like mean height of students in a class) and a confidence level (95%) associated with it to signify our ""confidence"" in this range.

"Hi Team,
I have one question which may seem silly:-
""Ok. Suppose I did EDA and came out with some observations and intuation about data
(eg.,after univariate,bivariate,descriptive,etc. analysis like how data is distributed,related,segmented).
Now, what we do with these observations(  before fitting to sklearn model,eg. LogisticRegression().fit() )?
I mean what is the purpose of these and where it is used for(before fitting into model)?
Is its done to SELECT FEATURES(by identifying and dropping the non-useful features), ENGINEER FEATURES(derivation of new features),impute missing values and handle outliers------->""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""SO THAT WE CAN HAVE REFINED DATASET TO FEED INTO THE models""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Is the quoted sentence is the sole purpose to get and collect intuation by EDA?

Thanks","Yes, you are right. There are more reasons for it as well:
1. Let's take for example you'd want to apply gaussian naive Bayes. Now the assumption is that the features are supposed to be Gaussian distributed and this requires us to explore our data to determine the distribution of our features.
2. You can also perform use correlation tests to explore which features are collinear(this creates a problem of interpretability of weight vectors in logistic/linear regression).

There are many such reasons why EDA is necessary and on a case, to case basis, you recognize what kind of EDA you'd perform."

Is this course (Applied AI course) equal or better or lesser than a masters degree in  Data science/machine learning? What does a masters degree cover that is not covered here? And what is covered in Applied AI that is not covered at a masters degree (compare and contrast Applied AI  Vs  a masters degree),"A typical master's degree focusses on theoretical breadth and depth and prepares you for a PhD program if you choose to pursue it. Some universities do offer more practical courses but lack in their scope of real-world problem-solving skills. Of course, based on the university, the master's degree could be a very valuable signal to recruiters/companies. In most universities, during your Master's program, you all learn lots of other subjects like Operating Systems, Algorithms, Databases etc.

Applied AI Course focusses a lot on applied/practical skills while building up your basics needed for ML/AI. You can think of it as a shorter path to transitioning into an ML career. We have many students who are currently pursuing Masters in some of the world's best universities taking our course to primarily build up their practical ML skills and build a portfolio to land an ML job.

So, Masters and AAIC are not disjoint. You can do both or either of them based on your career interests and goals."

In your course you teach developing ML models using python. But python code can't be uploaded in any micro controller. So do you  guys teach developing ML models in C or C++ so that such code can be uploaded in micro controller for remote real time application.,"Good question. We currently do not teach building ML models in C/C++ as there is not good support for C/C++ for many ML tasks. We preferred to use Python in this course as it the most popular choice in the industry for most ML tasks.

It is possible to build a model in Python and port it to C/C++ code easily which is very common in the industry for latency requirements and we describe that in detail in this video."
"The video you shared shows  'content of the item is restricted'. Can you guide me how after completing your course,I will be able to make ML models in C/C++.","If you are not an enrolled student, you may not be able to access all of the course content. Translating models from Python to C/C++ for deployment is fairly straightforward as most models involve simple matrix/array/logical operations as shown below.
1. Logistic regression, Linear regression: Multiply two vectors/arrays 
2. Decision Tree, RandomForest and GBDT: Nested if-else statements.
3. Deep-learning models: Sequence of n-dim array multiplications.
4. SVM: Sum of products of arrays.

You might still want to train the models in Python as there are tons of good libraries to do so. But, when it comes to productionizing the models on a microcontroller, you can port these models easily to C/C++/ASM code as most ML models involve mostly n-dim array operations or logical operators at run-time. Training models on a microcontroller may be hard as you will need to write lots of code in C/C++ and training a model is compute, memory and power intensive which you don't want to perform on a microcontroller."
"Thanks for your reply. Looking forward to joining Applied AI Course. 
Just a suggestion. It will be very helpful if you guys cover building ML models in C/C++. Because restricting the course till python and research is not justice to our skills which we will be developing through your course. At the end anything we develop must have some market value.","We strongly believe that you will be able to easily build C/C++ production models at the end of this course if you are already proficient in C/C++. If there are any issues in that regard as you progress through the course, we will surely help you. 

From our own experience, it is not optimal to choose multiple languages in this course as that could create confusion and overwhelm many of the students."
Why EDA topic has been introduced before covering probability and statistics ?,We introduce many concepts in Probability and Stats and Plotting in EDA chapter itself. EDA chapter takes a practical example to help students understand concepts from a practical standpoint using plots and graphical means.
"Sir, are there any plans of preparing videos on GANs , Boltzman Machines, RBMs , etc ??......the applications of them were quite interesting.","Yes, we will introduce some of these new topics to the course in the next few weeks. You will get an email update of new videos added to the course."

Hi I am interested in this course. So I want to know that what kind of laptop configuration is good for ml and deep learning course since I have heard that it requires a lot of processing power to run smoothly. I have searched a lot over the internet but still I am confused. Please help me. Thanks,"We keep most of our deep-learning case studies simple enough so that all of our students can try them out on their basic laptops. But, if are keen to get a new system for deep-learning, it is cost effective to buy a desktop with NVIDIA graphics cards like GTX 1060, 1070 or 1080 based on your budget. Laptops with comparable configurations cost much more than desktops."
"Hi There, Do you cover NLP in the course?","We have partly covered the NLP concepts in our course. We have discussed some of the techniques like bag of words, tf-idf, word2vec, average word2vec etc"

Our course content is created using the broadest definition in mind so that our students can crack any interview for all of these roles in most companies. Hence, if you are looking for Data-Scientist roles, we recommend you cover all of these concepts."
"Hello,
                I have two questions 
                1)After completion of this course, can I be a part of any machine learning (even the latest and most advanced) project and work and contribute for it??
                 2)After completion of this course can I crack the interview for entry level machine learning engineer or data scientist position of even big Tech Giants like Google,Facebook etc??","1. Yes, we would love to work with you on state of the art projects if you are able to showcase your skills and depth of understanding in the assignments.
2.Some of our students to are already interviewing with top notch companies. Aditionally, data scientists from some of the top notch companies you mentioned are taking our course to expand thier practical knowledge. To get an interview call from top notch companies, your portfolio needs to be very high quality with at least 3-5 very good case studies which we will mentor you on."
As I am planning to do MS is Machine learning If I complete this course or in the middle somewhere can I get LOR based on my performance.,Audio reply: https://soundcloud.com/applied-ai-course/letter-of-recommendation-for
"Why increasing or decreasing C causes overfit or underfit.? What is the mathematics reason behind regularization or C parameter here. Can 
anyone help me to understand how it would effect when we start taking the derivatives of cost function? I don't get a clear picture of what does 
penalizing the coefficient means?
Similarly in the logistic regression regularization equation. Why increasing or decreasing lambda effects derivative of cost function.
It will be very helpful if anyone can take some dummy numbers and help me understand what we mean by penalizing coefficient in both SVM and Logistic?","This has been explained in detail as the tradeoff between loss-minimization and regularization in the following videos in the corresponding chapters of Logistic regression and SVMs.

A shorter and simpler intuitive explanation can be found here: [Audio reply]"
Why is the equation of plane in SVM taken w(t)X+b=1? Is it same as straight line equation. Why perpendicular vector w is taken as coefficient? Where it came from?,"The eqn of a plane that doesn't pass through origin is w.x+b=0 can also be written as w.x+b'=1 if b' = b+1.

We take the eqn of two planes to be w.x+b = +/- 1 and not w.x+b=0 in the case of SVM as we have two planes: one for +ve hyperplane with RHS = +1 and another for -ve hyperplane with RHS = -1. Now the distance between these planes is 2/||W|| and this formulation shows that the +ve and -ve hyperplanes are exactly at the same distance (1/||w||) from the separating hyperplane w.x+b=0. We take the eqns in this form primarily to make the simpler for us to work with."
"Hi, im from telecom background, can you help me build portfolio on the basis of telecom background.. i want to work on telecom case studies. do you have it to help me, so that i can enrol for this course","Raghavendra, the case studies we discuss will help you solve a wide spectrum of case studies across many domains. As part of your portfolio projects, we encourage you to pick problems in your core domain which is telecom. We will surely work with you on solving these case-studies. First, I recommend you complete the course content, assignments and case-studies to get a good idea of ML and AI."
"thanks for your response. I called to one of your team member and he said on phone that you will be giving problems on telecom domain, so that i can build portfolio around that. could you please confirm if its true? I majorly need a curriculum build on telecom projects. Few of my collegues are also interested but all r looking for projects around the domain.",I am glad you called us. We will certainly help you pick projects from telecom domain for your portfolio projects.
"Do you also teach, how to deploy ML model/algos in production from an end to end perspective? What all infrastructure set up would be required for ML models to be up and running? Also how frequently is it requiried to retrain or improve the models already deployed in Production region?","We cover some of the key aspects like how to deploy models in various environments like low-latency and high-throughput systems, how to use scikit-learn itself and when to build your custom function evaluation systems in this video called ""productizing models"": https://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/applied-ai-course-online/lessons/productionizing-models/

We also discuss when and how to retrain models in production here: https://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/applied-ai-course-online/lessons/retraining-models-periodically/

We discuss A/B testing models in production here:https://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/applied-ai-course-online/lessons/a-b-testing/

We also discuss about the lifecycle of a project and real-world challenges here: https://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/applied-ai-course-online/lessons/data-science-life-cycle/

It is impossible to go over every possible production environment that can be used for ML deployment as the number of production configurations is very high.  We also do NOT go into distributed ML as of now. But, it should be easy to pick up these concepts as this course provides all the necessary fundamentals. If you have specific production environment in mind,  please email us with your phone number and we can discuss it in a 1-1 session.  We have some data-scientist taking this course now whom we have helped with 1-1 sessions."
"I am from programming background(mobile apps and nodejs) and understand the basics of Python, but i dont know math. Does this course suitable for me.","sachin, we will teach every thing from scratch. 
Coming to math part, we will cover all the things which are required for machine learning and deep learning. You can check out our syllabus."
There are no programming assignment and project then how will student implement their knowledge they learned so far,There are 30 programming assignments in our course.
"HI team, Will you teach AI And ML?
or only Phython??","This online Machine Learning course which we provide consists of 140+ hours of content covering Python, Probability, and Statistics, LinearAlgebra, Data Visualization, Machine Learning techniques, Deep Learning techniques and 13+ real-world case studies solved end to end solving problems at companies like Amazon, Facebook, Quora, Uber, Netflix etc"
Hi Team - Will dis course also give me a good idea of analytics concepts as i think the fields are related.,"This course will teach you concepts of data analysis, probability, statistics, and data visualization which lie at the core of data-analytics. It teaches you all these concepts from a practical standpoint using Python. 

What we do NOT teach are tools like Tableau and Excel which are simple UI tools to perform data analysis. We help you understand what is happening inside these tools and be able to build the functionality they provide from scratch in Python."
"Hi Team,

Can you share any assessments on the python programming or any sample programs to solve in python.",we have actually posted some of the optional assignments in google classroom.
"Do we get to know about the case studies if we enroll to this course?
Or do we need to pay extra of 15000/- for each case study?","Ram, if you enrol for a full course you will get all case studies. Please check out the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQeu5OTd2-M"
"Throughout your website, you refer to this course as ""Applied Machine Learning..."" whereas your courseware says ""Applied AI ..."".
Which one is correct?
I know both are closely related, but AI, for sure, is much broader than the ML, If my understanding is correct.  Please clarify.",audio reply: https://soundcloud.com/appliedai-course/whatsapp-ptt-2018-06-15-at-152741
"Hi there,
I currently work in a product based company in Tech support with an inclination towards Machine learning, honestly because it is an emerging and interesting field. I read all the comments in here, just to be sure if this is the right and dependable place for a career change and I was quite convinced looking at the comments and your website. I did read that there is no prerequisite for joining this course. However, I do not have any basic understanding of c, c++ or Java to be frank. The only thing I know is sql, so would that be enough to understand the flow of the whole course and eventually land up into the job like you promise on your website (Taking the written criteria into consideration)? Could you please give me a definitive answer if possible, because I’m really confused and could use a mentor? Thanking you in advance! You can also reach out to me at manishshinde9999@gmail.com","We recommend you watch our free videos on Python in our course. If you can understand them, there is no need for concern about understanding the programming part of the course. You can easily self evaluate yourself. Please checkout the other videos of other concepts also as they will help you understand if you will be able to cope with the course content.

Knowing SQL is very helpful as you will understand data processing much more easily than others who don't know it."
"With MLaaS platforms available with Azure & AWS, do we still need to have fair understanding of linear algebra / statistics / calculus ? And how your course complements these public cloud platforms, will I still need them ?","Most MLaaS platforms help data-scientists (DS) build, productionize, deploy and iterate their solutions faster. They do not replace the deep-knowledge that DS needs to have to solve real-world problems well. We do not teach how to use AzureML or AWS-ML or Google-ML in this course as of now. We teach the core-fundamentals of ML which will make picking up any of these platforms a week-end task. In the real-world, you may still use many of these MLaaS to speed-up your work and have access to cloud-scale compute, storage and processes.

A good analogy to MLaaS is with Compilers. Compilers made programmers life simpler and made programming significantly faster but it didn't replace programmers need for having a good grasp of programming languages and code-optimizations."
This course seems to be extremely focused on machine learning algorithms so - Are you also going to add some intensive specific application of deep learning like some projects only related to computer vision like face detection ? If not please try to add these intensive projects too to make this course a exceptional one!,"We have covered Deep-MLPs, CNNs, and RNNs in lots of detail in the later chapters in this course. We also have computer-vision specific applications like building a self-driving car using Deep-learning. We will certainly be adding more deep-learning case-studies in the future as this course content is very dynamic and evolving."
"I support this idea. It would be great if we have a case study - Text extraction from an image and classify the text using CNN. 
Very much interested in OCR methods.","That would be fairly easy for you to learn and build as this course provides all of the necessary basics. 
We strongly encourage our students to be able to learn new concepts on thier own by the end of the course. We want our students to be life long leanrers leveraging tons of resources on the internet once they get the basics right.

Many of our students have taken up case studies on fairly advanced problems builidng upon the basics they learn in this course.

If one of our students can opt in to take up this as thier case study for thier portflio, we will help you though the case study. gskr82, are you up for it?

For this specific problem, there are two parts to it. First, detect the part of the image that has text and then recognize the text using OCR.

A quick Google search provides the following resource which are easy to follow and build upon once you go though the course content:
https://medium.com/syncedreview/stn-ocr-a-single-neural-network-for-text-detection-and-text-recognition-220debe6ded4

Alternatively, you can google search for ""text localization in images"" for detecting the location of text and then search ""OCR using CNN"" for the OCR component."
Are you also going to cover tutorials of Tableau for data visualization  in the course because i think it's mostly used in industry  ?,"No, we are not teaching Tableau. While Tableau is used in the industry, it is a GUI tool like Microsoft Excel. We are more focussed on core Data analysis, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning wherein you learn how to build each of the visualizations available in Tableau from scratch in Python.

The concepts you learn in this course will help you better understand how Tableau's internal plotting systems work and which plotting tool to use based on context. By the end of this course, you will be able to build a simplified version of Tableau like tool in Python."
"As mentioned in your website so is it true that you people are giving 100% job guarantee .
If yes on what basis you are giving this commitment ,I am sure there will be some term and conditions , what are those?","Here is a detailed explanation of the process and terms and conditions: https://www.appliedaicourse.com/job-guarantee/. This link is also available on our homepage in the top menu.

If you prefer a video explaining the same, please check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbgJ5H3JnZU.

We are very clear of our promise: If you finish the 30 mandatory assignments (without plagiarism) in the course, which you can comfortably solve if you go through the video content and spend time-solving these assignments, we will place you in an ML job within six months of completing the assignments.  For some reason, if we fail to do so, we will refund your course fee."
"Good Evening. I am looking for a class on multivariate regression (multiple dependent variables). Would this be covered as part of your course or if i register, can you point to material that i can refer to?","One way to handle multivariate regression is to think of it as building k regressors if the output is a k-dimensional vector. We cover regressors in detail in the course.

Another method would be to train a Nueral net that has k activation units in the last layer which we cover in detail in our Nueral networks and deep learning sections.

If you have specific problem that you want to solve, we can certainly help you with the appropriate references."
"good evening sir,
as R programming language is used in statistics works, then why it is not being taught in your course...Is there anyother contents present which you provide that substitute the requirement of that language?","Today, the most popular language for data-science, ML and deep-learning is Python. Hence, we have used Python throughout this course and we teach Python from scratch.  While R is being used in some companies, students who finish our course can easily pickup R as they have all the fundamentals of data-science, ML and programming. Our course is only a starting point in your journey in data-science and ML and not an end. We provide all of the basics needed for you to be a lifelong learner and to transition into an ML career."
"Hello,

  Once registered and the course is completed by a candidate if you guys add some more advanced topics to the course then what is your payment policy for alumni to register for the part which he/she didn't get?","if we add some new topics as a part of this course, there won't be any charge for that."
"Where we will get the assignments of Python intro and Python data structures? I mean that whatever is there in the video thats it, or we will be getting some extra practice set? Please reply soon.",assignments will be posted in google classroom.
Hello sir please share the coupon code for the free workshop,Please send an email to team@appliedaicourse.com and we would provide you the coupon code for the workshop.

"hello sir 
will you help us plot the code in github so that we can showcase our work to the companies ??","yes, we do. along with GitHub, you also create a portfolio on our website."
After completing the course will i be able to compete on kaggle?,"Yes, you can compete on www.kaggle.com without any doubt. but to submit those solutions you need to change the error functions."
Will that going to be covered under same course,"Yes, Deeplearning is part of this course"
Sir for the free workshop course.Will you provide any certification?Does the workshop include any project?,"yes, in this workshop will solve a real-time problem, please go through https://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/apparel-recommendation-engine-workshop/ page to get more information about this. you will get the certificate after successful completion of the assignment that was given at the end of the workshop."
does this course have all the projects which are being sold separately for rs15000 each?,The course will contain all the case studies that are mentioned on the website.
"Sir after successfully completing AI course, you are going to provide a certificate. What would be the parameter to assess the performance for grading criteria on certificate ? How would you refer us to companies after the course ?","the certificate we will provide will have a grade on it, the grading will be based on your performance throughout the course, results you get in the case studies, and the quality of the portfolio that you build during the entire course. 
we have 2 certificates, one is course completion and the other one is course participation, the course completion certificate will be given to the folks who will submit at least 5 case studies out of 10, the guys who get A, A+ we will personally take responsibility to forward their resumes and portfolios to top tier companies."
If someone does not have such a good grade then what can they do and which type of company will they get an interview.,we will make you work little harder to your improve concepts and more personal case studies.
"i am not sure why you mentioned C programming. As far my understanding python would do. 
But if incase i am missing something, please do clarify me my doubt.","Yes if you know python, then it will be more than enough to start"
Sir it will be very helpful to many students including me if you can discuss about VC dimensions in your course. People all around India and all around the Internet give different explanations but are not clear about the concept of VC Dimensions,it's true. we will try to include it in our course contents.
"I also have same problem, not clear about the concept of VC Dimension. So it will be helpful if you make video of that","Sure, we will try to include as part of this course"
